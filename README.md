We address the issue of increasing the overall efficiency of automated robots during operation, and the problem of agile swing free trajectory tracking of a quad rotor with suspended load. The topic has great practical significance in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) applications. This aims at modelling, designing routines, and estimation of an industrial robot. Specific methods have been proposed to enhance the robot’s performance and it has been tested under different real-time environments, such as self protection and awareness, pattern overriding, algorithm design, human interference control, Incorporation of PID theory and data base definitions. This can be utilized for industrial operations which synchronizes both ‘terrestrial’ as well as ‘aerial’ robots.
